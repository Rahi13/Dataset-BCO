Dataset-BCO
========================

### BCO_Spec_V1.2
-----------------
This example was developed with the [Data integration use case](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Spec_V1.2/blob/master/BCO_Spec_V1.2.md#data-integration-use-case) in mind. 

* A BCO can be used to provide clarity and transparency of the data integration process to both the new and existing collaborators. When new data is integrated into the existing data model, BCO can be used to describe data source information (eg- authors/contributors, data version etc), a QC workflow, data content, data modification if any. The BCO also allows reuse of the same workflow to integrate new data with same structure and source. BCO also provides a way to access and track data records which were eliminated in the integration/QC process due to rules or restrictions of the existing data model. Knowledgebases using BCOs in the form of ‘readme’ can provide provenance for every piece of data that is collected and presented to the user. Such granular tracking facilitates fair sharing of data and provides mechanisms for adherence to licensing requirements associated with specific datasets.
