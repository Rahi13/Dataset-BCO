  List of human [taxid:9606] proteins with information on glycosylation sites from UniCarbKB database [https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/D1/D215/1052197, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1128] 
  The file also includes GlyTouCan accessions and UniCarbKB structure ids for associated glycan structures.
 
Description Domain
  Keywords: protein, canonical, glycosylation, glycan
  
  Pipeline Steps:
    Step 1: The input file was retrieved directly from source.
    Step 2: The UniProt protein accessions in the input file were mapped to UniProt canonical accessions using a python script.
    Step 3: The glycosylation type [linkage type] was retrieved through UniCarbKB structure webpage using scripts [make-proteoform_glycosylation_sites_unicarbkb_glytoucan-csv-step2a.py, make-proteoform_glycosylation_sites_unicarbkb_glytoucan-csv-step2b.py]
    Step 4: The file was processed for quality check using a python script[make-proteoform_glycosylation_sites_unicarbkb_glytoucan-csv-step3.py]. Records which fall under one or more following criteria's are flagged and eliminated [eliminated records can be acessed using log file]:
             a. If the protein accession is not included in UniProt protein list [UniProt Nov-2017 Release]
             b. If the amino acid position does not match to the amino acid on the associated position on fasta sequence [UniProt Nov-2017 Release]
             c. If the id [UnicarbKB structure id] is not present in input file.
             d. If the glycosylation type [linkage type] is not retrieved through step 3
             e. If a serine or threonine is reported for an N-linked glycan structure. 
             f. If an asparagine is reported for an O-linked glycan structure.
